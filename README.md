Remember to download all the scripts and icons folder, store them both on the same folder.

Make sure that the scripts are in the same folder with :

	videos folder - the folder where the videos are stored.
	TSSCI folder - where the final TSSCI image will be stored.
	frames folder - where the frames of each video will be stored.
	animation folder - this is the folder where the mediaPlayer will store animation files.
	jsons folder - the folder where openPose will stores jsons files.
